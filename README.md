# python-algorithms
Algorithms written in Python 3 language.
Currently there are two algorithms:
* [Bloom Filter](https://github.com/denis-mo/python-algorithms/blob/master/bloomfilter.py)
* [Merkle Tree](https://github.com/denis-mo/python-algorithms/blob/master/merkletree.py)
  
### Tests
Each algorithm comes with tests. To run tests please execute the command in the root folder:

* For Bloom Filter `python3 -m test.test_bloomfilter`
* For Merkle Tree `python3 -m test.test_merkletree`
